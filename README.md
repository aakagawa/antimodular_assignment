### Objective
Develop an application that uses a live webcam feed to capture text from objects such as product labels, book titles, and packaging.

### Requirements
- Extract subsections of the image where text is detected.
- Convert the extracted image text to unicode characters using OCR.
- Display the results on the screen, stacking them akin to a table format that juxtaposes the cropped images and their corresponding unicode text.

### Notes
- By "webcam", we refer to any USB or built-in camera attached to your computer.
- You're free to choose the programming language for this task, whether it's JS, C++, Python, etc.
- Document your process and results through a screen-recording that clearly showcases all implemented features.
- Share your source code along with any necessary documentation on usage or installation.
